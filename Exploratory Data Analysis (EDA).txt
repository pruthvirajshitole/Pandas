Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential process in data analysis that involves investigating 
the data to summarize its main characteristics, often with visual methods. Below are the key steps typically followed in EDA:

 1. Data Collection
   - Gather the data: Collect the data from relevant sources, such as databases, CSV files, APIs, etc.
   - Data understanding: Ensure you understand the data source and context (e.g., business objectives, data collection methods, etc.).
         
 2. Data Cleaning
   - Handle missing data: Identify and treat missing values through imputation, removal, or using placeholders.
   - Remove duplicates: Check for and eliminate any duplicate rows to ensure accurate analysis.
   - Correct errors: Fix any errors like incorrect values, typos, or inconsistencies in the data.
   - Data type conversion: Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., changing string to date, integer to float).
   
 3. Data Transformation
   - Feature engineering: Create new features based on existing ones, if necessary.
   - Scaling and normalization: Standardize numerical values to ensure uniformity, especially when different features have different scales (e.g., min-max scaling, z-score standardization).
   - Encoding categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical values (e.g., using one-hot encoding, label encoding).

 4. Univariate Analysis
   - Statistical summary: Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each feature.
   - Visualize distributions:
     - Histograms for numerical variables to observe their distribution.
     - Box plots for identifying outliers and understanding data spread.
     - Bar plots for categorical variables to understand their frequency.

 5. Bivariate Analysis
   - Correlation analysis: Examine relationships between two numerical variables using correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson, Spearman).
   - Cross-tabulation: For categorical variables, analyze their relationship with other categorical variables using contingency tables.
   - Scatter plots: Plot numerical features against each other to explore relationships and patterns.
   - Pair plots: If dealing with multiple variables, use pair plots to visualize pairwise relationships.

 6. Multivariate Analysis
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality of the data if there are many features, helping to identify the most important variables.
   - Heatmaps: Visualize correlation matrices to identify relationships between multiple variables.
   - Cluster analysis: Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to group similar observations and uncover hidden patterns.

 7. Outlier Detection
   - Identify outliers: Detect outliers using box plots, z-scores, or IQR methods.
   - Assess impact: Evaluate whether outliers should be removed or adjusted based on the context.
   
 8. Visualization
   - Visual exploration: Use visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots to better understand patterns, trends, and relationships.
   - Distribution visualization: Show distributions of numerical data with tools like KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plots.

 9. Summary and Insights
   - Interpret findings: Summarize the key findings from your analysis, highlighting trends, correlations, and outliers.
   - Feature importance: Identify which features are most important for predictive models, if applicable.
   - Hypothesis generation: Formulate hypotheses for further exploration based on insights gained from EDA.

 10. Data Modeling (Optional)
   - Model testing: If the goal of EDA is to build a predictive model, select algorithms and split the data for training and testing.
   - Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc., based on the EDA insights.
